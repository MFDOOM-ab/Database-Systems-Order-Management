Order Management System
Based on Local Industrial Environment


The overall basis of this OMS software is to help businesses manage and track orders through multiple sales channels. Since most industrial businesses all require inventory management, it would be useful to have a medium that can assist in dealing with complex orders involving multiple products, components and suppliers. The overall effect of this software is that it will positively affect order management time, sorting, and deliveries. Our data is a collection of products that will be considered inventory, clients/customers, and possibly an employee hierarchy access role collection that will most likely be initially created by hand in the database.

Software Purpose:

Improve order accuracy and fulfillment times
Reduce inventory management costs
Improve customer satisfaction
Increase operations efficiency
